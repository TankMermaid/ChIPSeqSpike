Description: Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation followed by Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) 
    is used to determine the binding sites of any protein of interest, such as 
    transcription factors or histones with or without a specific modification, 
    at a genome scale. The many steps of the protocol can introduce biases that
     make ChIP-Seq more qualitative than quantitative. For instance, it was 
     shown that global histone modification differences are not caught by 
     traditional downstream data normalization techniques. A case study 
     reported no differences in histone H3 lysine-27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) upon 
     Ezh2 inhibitor treatment. To tackle this problem, external spike-in 
     control were used to keep track of technical biases between conditions. 
     Exogenous DNA from a different non-closely related species was inserted 
     during the protocol to infer scaling factors that enabled an accurate 
     normalization, thus revealing the inhibitor effect.
     ChIPSeqSpike offers tools for ChIP-Seq spike-in normalization. Ready to 
     use scaled bigwig files and scaling factors values are obtained as output.
     ChIPSeqSpike also provides tools for ChIP-Seq spike-in assessment and 
     analysis through a versatile collection of graphical functions.
